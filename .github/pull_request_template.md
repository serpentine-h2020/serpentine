<!-- These comments are hidden when you submit the pull request, so you do not need to remove them! -->

<!-- When you add changed ipynb files to the pull request, their metadata will be automatically checked. This will almost always trigger an error by pre-commit.ci. Don't worry! This can be fixed automatically.

When you are done with the pull request and are ready to submit it, answer here with a comment containing only "pre-commit.ci autofix" (without quotation marks). This will trigger a pre-commit process that cleans the ipynb metadata and push the changes to the pull request. This means that you should afterwards pull the changes to your local copy!  -->
